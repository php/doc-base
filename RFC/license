From Hartmut Holgraefe

here's an ascii version of the license section my "manual and beyond"
RFC paper i'd used as a preparation of my conference talk in frankfurt

i tried to analyse the copyright situation and the choice of licenses
as i saw it back then (almost half a year ago) and have added a small
update:

   License and Copyright

    The current phpdoc repository is licensed under the GPL and
    copyright holders are the members of the PHP Documentation Group as
    listed on the Manual front page. As the GPL focuses on code and not
    on documentation content it is not really the right choice for
    protecting the manual. There has been some discussion on the phpdoc
    mailing list every once in a while but no conclusion has been
    reached yet. So i'll try to present some of the licenses that might
    fit and their goals, pros and cons.



    License Goals

     Whatever the new license will be, it has to make sure that
     copyright is kept intact and that nobody but the copyright holders
     may change the license, neither in original nor in modified form
     and that the original authors and contributers get the credits
     they deserve. It has not become clear whether commercial
     distribution should be possible or not.



    The FreeBSD Documentation License

     The FreeBSD Documentation License is very much like the modified
     BSD license. It does not restrict redistribution and/or
     modification at all as long as the license and copyright notice is
     kept intact.


    The Open Content License

     The Open Content License allows modifications as long as the
     license and copyright are kept intact and modified versions are
     clearly marked as such, but it does not permit
     charging for the distribution of the content itself, you may only
     charge for media and for additional services you provide related
     to the content.



    The Open Publishing License

     The Open Publishing License (not to be confused with the Open
     Content License) goes more into the details of publishing and
     defines fair use of content. It does, for example, require that
     the original authors have to be printed on the cover if the
     content is published in book form.
     The original license is rather liberal regarding modifications and
     commercial publishing, but there are two license options that can
     be added to deny substantial modifications or commercial
     publishing without special permission.



    The GNU Free Documentation License

     This License goes even more into detail as it was the only one of
     those presented here that was created with the help of
     professional lawyers. It tries to define the details of fair use
     similar to the Open Publishing License, but with a slightly
     different focus. It does not prevent modifications or commercial
     distribution as long as copyright and license are kept intact and
     modifications are made available in source form.



    Conclusion (sort of)

     IMHO commercial distribution of the PHP documentation should not
     be restricted as the distribution of PHP itself is not restricted
     in that way, too. On the other hand the FreeBSD Documentation
     License, that is very similar to the PHP License, does not really
     solve the issues in which the current GPL lacks. In the spirit of
     the current license the GNU Free  Documentation
     License should be the best choice. All contributions to the manual
     have been made under the GPL, and although the copyright holders
     that the copyright for these contributions has been transfered to
     have the right to change the license for future versions they should
     perhaps stay in the same spirit when changing the license for
     practical reasons. If the final decision regarding commercial
     redistribution goes against me, then the Open Publication License
     including option 'B' should be the best choice for a new manual
     license.

PS: this has been written almost half a year ago now and some things
     have changed since then. we have a new, BSDish Zend Engine license
     and ZendAPI documentation has been bundled with the manual and
     is even about to be merged with it on the source level
     so today i'd rather suggest to just switch to the OPL and use
     the same options as the zendAPI doc
