[TARGET]

Installpart in Chapters en/chapters/install.xxx.xml files

[Situation]

The current structure is very bad.
We need more deep sections (not sections emulated in titles).

[SOLUTION]

Main parts divided by OS.

- MacOS
- Linux
  Apache
  Apache2
  thttp ....
- Unices like HP/UX, BSD'S
- Windows
  Apache
  Apache2
  IIS/PWS
  Netscape
  OmniHTTP
  Sambar
  Xitami ....

Each main OS-chapter contains:
- General install instructions of PHP as CLI/CGI/FASTCGI/
- Supported Webservers and install instructions


This is of course only a very minimalistic suggestion, which needs more
discussion. A more detailed outwork of the structure is desirable.

[THINGS TO TAKE CARE OF]

- The files also need a polish, rename, etc.
- User notes: move user notes with the pages, or integrate all possible
  user notes and drop the others...
