## Quality Assurance Tools (QA Tools)

There are various scripts available to ensure the quality of the documentation
and find issues with it, they are located in the `scripts/qa/` directory.

There might be some more just in `scripts/` but they need to be checked if they
are still relevant and/or given some love.

## Translation Tools

There are also various scripts to ensure the quality and synchrony of
documentation translations, located in the `scripts/translation/` directory.
