This is a minimal version of the DocBook DSSSL Style Sheet
distribution, which you can download from
http://docbook.sourceforge.net/.

Except the catalog file, nothing is modified in these files,
all files are left untouched, so these are the same files you
can find in the distribution. We omitted some files and
directories though, and only left those that we use for
output generation.

The reason to put this to phpdoc was to encourage compatibility,
so we don't need to force users to have a specific version of
the DSSSL style sheets locally, but we can still rely on a version
of the sheets we tested our customizations with.
