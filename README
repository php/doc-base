READ THIS FIRST

    This directory contains source files and a setup for converting
    PHP's XML documentation into presentation formats like HTML and
    RTF. You should not have to bother with this unless you are
    writing documentation yourself, or if you simply are curious
    about how the XML stuff works.

    If you just want to read the documentation, look at
    http://www.php.net/docs.php

HOW TO WRITE PHPDOC FILES

    If you are interested in information about how to
    set up the tools needed, how to work with CVS and
    DocBook on Linux or Windows, or what conventions you
    should follow when writing phpdoc files, please refer
    to the PHP Documentation HOWTO. You can find it in
    the howto directory of the phpdoc module which can
    be build locally like so:

        make howto
        cd howto/html/

    It can also be downloaded from the web or viewed online:

        http://www.php.net/manual/howto/
        http://cvs.php.net/co.php/phpdoc/howto/howto.html.tar.gz?p=1
   
    For questions on how to use CVS, consult the anoncvs docs and 
    apply to your (phpdoc) needs.  Remember to use your PHP CVS 
    username/password and checkout the module named phpdoc.
    Translation information is located in the HOWTO.

FILE LOCATIONS

    The old archived phpdoc files still live in the phpdoc module 
    for historical purposes, do NOT edit them.  For example:
    
    OLD:  All function definitions and reference info for extensions
          used to be stored in single xml files:

          {lang}/functions/{extension}.xml
    	  
    NOW:  They are now separate and the format looks like so:
            
          {lang}/reference/{extension}/functions/{function}.xml
                                      /configure.xml
                                      /constants.xml
                                      /ini.xml
                                      /reference.xml

                                      /functions.xml (autogenerated)

QUICKREF
    
    a) Make the change.  Use spaces not tabs.  Be sure to carefully 
       watch your whitespace!

    b) Look at your unified diff, make sure it looks right and that 
       whitespace changes aren't mixed in:
	 
           cvs diff -u path/to/file.xml
	 
    c) Make sure no errors are present, so at the command line in your 
       phpdoc source directory run:

           make test
	   
       Always 'make test' before commit!

    d) Commit your changes
      
           cvs commit path/to/file.xml
	 
    Read the HOWTO for more information.  After reading the HOWTO,
    email the phpdoc mailing list (phpdoc@lists.php.net) with questions 
    and concerns.
