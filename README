READ THIS FIRST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------   
    This directory contains source files and a setup for converting
    PHP's XML documentation into presentation formats like HTML and
    RTF. You should not have to bother with this unless you are
    writing documentation yourself, or if you simply are curious
    about how the XML stuff works.

    If you just want to read the documentation, look at:
        http://www.php.net/docs

HOW TO WRITE PHPDOC FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------   
    If you are interested in information about how to
    set up the tools needed, how to work with CVS and
    DocBook on Linux or Windows, or what conventions you
    should follow when writing phpdoc files, please refer
    to the PHP Documentation HOWTO.
     
    You can read the HOWTO online at:
        http://doc.php.net/php/dochowto/
        
    Or download a tar.gz containing the whole contents:
        http://php.net/get/dochowto
    
    If you are already working with the phpdoc module,
    then you can find its XML source in the howto directory
    of the module, and build it yourself with:

        make howto
        cd howto/html/

FILE LOCATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The file locations are as follows:
            
    {lang}/reference/{extension}/functions/{function}.xml
                                /configure.xml
                                /constants.xml
                                /ini.xml
                                /reference.xml

                                /functions.xml (autogenerated)

    Translated files live within their own CVS modules.

QUICK REFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [[edits]]
    
    a) Make the change.  Use spaces not tabs.  Be sure to carefully 
       watch your whitespace!

    b) Look at your unified diff, make sure it looks right and that 
       whitespace changes aren't mixed in:
	 
           cvs diff -u path/to/file.xml
	 
    c) Make sure no errors are present, so at the command line in your 
       phpdoc source directory run:

           make test
	   
       Always 'make test' before commit!  In order to check the validity
       of your XML you may run the following command (requires xmllint):

           make test_xml

       Because test_xml takes so long you may instead check one file at a 
       time by using the xml-check.php script like so:

           scripts/xml-check.php en/reference/mysql/functions/mysql-connect.xml

       This will find other problems that 'make test' ignores, problems like 
       a forgotten & or ; on an entity.

    d) Commit your changes
      
           cvs commit path/to/file.xml
	 
    Read the HOWTO for more information.  After reading the HOWTO,
    email the phpdoc mailing list (phpdoc@lists.php.net) with questions 
    and concerns.

  [[new functions]]
  
    a) Copy an existing xml file or use a skeleton from the HOWTO.
       Rename and place it into the appropriate directory.

    b) Edit.  Be sure no leftover text exists.  No tabs either.

    c) Now test locally before commit by first running
       ./configure along with 'make test' as usual.
    
    d) cvs add path/to/yourfile.xml
    
    e) cvs commit path/to/yourfile.xml
  
    Note that ./configure adds your function to functions.xml as
    this allows 'make test' to test your new function.  Also, note 
    that version numbers are taken care of elsewhere (don't worry 
    about them)
