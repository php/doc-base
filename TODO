TODO for the PHP documentation project.

Add things that should be updated/added in the documentation here. For
big (i.e. time-consuming) items, add your name to it when you start
working on it, to prevent double-work.

DISCUSSIONS:
  - coding standards for scripts in phpdoc (see the howto
    and phpdoc/RFC/coding_standards)
  - licensing issues, possible licenses: see phpdoc/RFC/license for the
    summary of Hartmut
  - users manual / developers manual division?
    effects on folders, files, make system, style sheets
  - category support for the reference part 
    (see also BUILD SYSTEM:  group and organize functions logically)
  - usage of new docbook 4 tags for oo class documentation
  - language styleguide in howto (for english) and translation
    trees (for the other languages)
  - new roles: seealso, newparameter, and changedparameter.

IMPORTANT:
  - connection handling: what about, what got nuked? 
  
BIG JOBS:
  - oci8: tfromm (?), asautins@veripost.net
  - sockets: 'available ;)'
  - Document all BC breaks and Deprecations, having them listed
    at a single location.
  - add individual changelogs for each function
  - consider adding beautified table for parameter definitions
    and meanings.  do this one extension at a time.
      - see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=103658209317795
  - build PDF's
      - see: RFC/pdf_problems
  - split the developers and users manuals up.  developers manual
    will be english only.
  - integrate the meeting findings from the protocol
      - see: RFC/protocol_20020310
        see: http://www.php-ev.de/documents/phpdoc/protocol.html

BUILD SYSTEM:
  - merge ZendAPI into phpdoc proper (imajes)	 
  - add translation support for ZendAPI (hartmut)
  - finish makefile cleanup (hartmut)
  - support both dsssl and xsl processors with configure/make (hartmut)
    problem: different processors seem to have different ideas on how
    to follow relative pathes when including files using SYSTEM entities    
  - improve XSL stylesheet customisation 
  - group and organize functions logically (databases, text proc, etc)
    (better support for that in docbook4)
    Needs more *discussion*:
      - maybe also group them on folder level, not just in TOC
      - maybe spread configure options, ini settings and
        features to these groups [in TOC and/or in folders]
      - add indexes of options, settings and features if
        previous change goes through
  - split install.configure.misc.xml, config.xml and maybe other
    huge files to manageable pieces
  - get back lost indexes, but add them as appendixes
    (index of tables, index of examples, index of config options)
  - merge back build system/style sheet improvements from 
    phpGtk and pear manual (hartmut)
  - nsgmls aka "make test" does not detect entity usage without
    trailing ';', either add additional checks or switch to a
    different, more XML-specific validator
  - add legacy.ent
      - see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=103893809326045
  - generate a list of all php.ini configure options
  - generate a list of all install configure options
  - generate a list of all examples
  - generate a list of all requirements from all resources.xml

GENERAL:
  - Document php://stdout etc feature for file functions.
    (superseded by need of general description of the new streams features?)
  - Update setcookie 
  - Document the diffs between strip[c]slashes(). Maybe just document
    for both of them what they do - exactly.
  - Add &note.no-safemode; to the bottom of each function that is 
    disabled in safe-mode.'
  - Add &note.not-threadsafe; to each extension/function
    that is not thread safe
  - add platform availability
  - Mark binary (un)safe functions
  - Add link to an example in the &tip.ob-capture;  Put this example
    and further explanation in a faq entry)
  - Bug the dev's to rename functions like hw_getobjectbyquerycollobj 
  - Document configure options in install.xml (mk, jan)
  - Acronym system:
      - see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=103679111400458
  - isset, empty, "" and the like...
      - see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=103817319931363

  (from php4/TODO):
  - update curl documentation

  (from bugs):
  - see bugs.php.net for now
