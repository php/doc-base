TODO for the PHP documentation project.

Add things that should be updated/added in the documentation here. For
big (i.e. time-consuming) items, add your name to it when you start
working on it, to prevent double-work.


IMPORTANT:
  - connection handling: what about, what got nuked? 


BIG JOBS:
  - oci8: tfromm (?), asautins@veripost.net
  - sockets: 'available ;)'


BUILD SYSTEM:
  - improve php detection in configure for win (hartmut)
  - finish makefile cleanup (hartmut)
  - support both dsssl and xsl processors with configure/make (hartmut)
  - improve XSL stylesheet customisation 
  - switch to docbook4 (hartmut)
    - add DTD
    - convert funcsynopsis to methodsynopsis (using scripts/process.php)
    - change configure/make
  - put translations in seperate cvs modules? (to be discussed)
  - translation detection on function level (hartmut)
    - easy way -> split reference files down to function level
      and keep current file-based detection mechanism
    - hard way -> keep files as they are and merge translated
      stuff into intermeditate xml before processing
    - write proposal for discussion (hartmut)


GENERAL:
  - Document that "return" returns from any file, not only
    included files.
  - Document php://stdout etc feature for file functions.
  - Update setcookie
  - Document the diffs between strip[c]slashes(). Maybe just document
    for both of them what they do - exactly.
  - Add &note.no-safemode; to the bottom of each function that is 
    disabled in safe-mode.'
  - Note which functions don't work with win32.
  - Note which functions only work with win32.
  - Mark binary (un)safe functions
  - Add example to the &tip.ob-capture; tip (preferable a link to
    a example)
  - Bug the dev's to rename functions like hw_getobjectbyquerycollobj 
  - Remark in shmop.xml whether or not the old shm_* funcnames still
    work in the current version of PHP. (search for the TODO mark)
  - Document configure options in install.xml (mk, jan)
  - Expand config.xml documentation (philip)
  - Update include/require _once docs (philip)

  (from php4/TODO):
  - update curl documentation
  - write documentation for the zziplib extension

  (from bugs):
  - see bugs.php.net for now
