TODO for the PHP documentation project.

Add things that should be updated/added in the documentation here. For
big (i.e. time-consuming) items, add your name to it when you start
working on it, to prevent double-work.

DISCUSSIONS:
  - coding standards for scripts in phpdoc (see the howto
    and phpdoc/RFC/coding_standards)
  - users manual / developers manual division?
    effects on folders, files, make system, style sheets
      - see: RFC/manual_splitting
  - category support for the reference part
    (see also BUILD SYSTEM:  group and organize functions logically)
  - usage of new docbook 4 tags for oo class documentation
  - language styleguide in howto (for english) and translation
    trees (for the other languages)

IMPORTANT:
  - connection handling: what about, what got nuked? 
  
BIG JOBS:
  - sockets: 'available ;)'
  - Document all BC breaks and Deprecations, having them listed
    at a single location.
  - build PDF's
      - see: RFC/pdf_problems
  - split the developers and users manuals up.  developers manual
    will be english only.
  - integrate the meeting findings from the protocol
      - see: RFC/protocol_20020310
        see: http://www.php-ev.de/documents/phpdoc/protocol.html
  - document every undocumented function.
      - see: http://www.zend.com/phpfunc/nodoku.php
             http://www.phpdoc.info/meta/phpsrc-vs-phpdoc.php
             http://doc.php.net/php/undoc_functions.php
  - add an example to most every function
      - see: http://doc.php.net/php/missing_examples.php
  - improve doc.php.net
      - see: http://doc.php.net/

BUILD SYSTEM:
  - finish makefile cleanup (hartmut)
  - group and organize functions logically (databases, text proc, etc)
    (better support for that in docbook4)
    Needs more *discussion*:
      - maybe also group them on folder level, not just in TOC
      - maybe spread configure options, ini settings and
        features to these groups [in TOC and/or in folders]
      - add indexes of options, settings and features if
        previous change goes through
    See bug #24861
  - split install.configure.misc.xml, config.xml and maybe other
    huge files to manageable pieces
      - see: en/reference/rsusi.txt for progress
  - get back lost indexes, but add them as appendices
    (index of tables, index of examples, index of config options)
  - merge back build system/style sheet improvements from 
    phpGtk and pear manual (hartmut)
  - nsgmls aka "make test" does not detect entity usage without
    trailing ';', either add additional checks or switch to a
    different, more XML-specific validator
    see: RFC/xml_validation
    Feb 10 2003: betz
     buildsystem checks for xmllint
     make test_xml manually invoked checks for trailing ; problem
  - add legacy.ent
      - see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=103893809326045
  - generate a list of all php.ini configure options
  - generate a list of all install configure options
  - generate a list of all examples
  - generate a list of all requirements from all resources.xml

GENERAL:
  - Merge php-src/CODING_STANDARDS with Zend API documentation
  - Review PECL resources available at http://pecl.php.net/support.php#tutorials
    and merge them into Zend API where appropriate
  - Document php://stdout etc feature for file functions.
    (superseded by need of general description of the new streams features?)
  - Add &note.no-safemode; to the bottom of each function that is 
    disabled in safe-mode.'
  - Add &note.not-threadsafe; to each extension/function
    that is not thread safe
  - add platform availability
  - Mark binary (un)safe functions
  - Add link to an example in the &tip.ob-capture;  Put this example
    and further explanation in a faq entry)
  - Bug the dev's to rename functions like hw_getobjectbyquerycollobj 
  - Document configure options in install.xml (mk, jan)
  - Acronym system:
      - see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=103679111400458
  - go through and make sure every function that takes on a parameter
    by reference has an example that clearly demonstrates that it's
    not a reference passed at call time.
  - Add a pointers section, perhaps in types.array
  - Tool: check all 'see also' links and ensure they are valid. For 
    example, make sure a function exists.
