TODO for the PHP documentation project.

Add things that should be updated/added in the documentation here. For
big (i.e. time-consuming) items, add your name to it when you start
working on it, to prevent double-work.


URGENT:

  - Note in sockets that the documentation is outdated, that
    it has always been experimental (until 4.0.6, that is),
	and that scripts that worked with PHP <= 4.0.5 will
	definitely NOT work with 4.0.6 or above. Not only 
	has there been renaming, the way the funcs work also
	changed dramatically.
  - Check out wether there are more experimental modules,
    and CLEARLY state so in the documentation.

	./ext/crack/EXPERIMENTAL
	./ext/ctype/EXPERIMENTAL
	./ext/dbx/EXPERIMENTAL

	)

GENERAL:

  - Document the diffs between strip[c]slashes(). Maybe just document
    for both of them what they do - exactly.
  - Add &note.no-safemode; to the bottom of each function that is 
    disabled in safe-mode.'
  - Note which functions don't work with win32.
  - Mark binary (un)safe functions
  - Add the ob-tip to all functions that output there results and have
    no straight-forward way of getting there contents in a string 
	(var_dump, highlight-string) (jeroen)
  - Add example to the &tip.ob-capture; tip (preferable a link to
    a example)
  - Bug the dev's to rename functions like hw_getobjectbyquerycollobj 
  - Add section on safemode (what is it for, which funcs disabled,
    why use it, etc.)
  - Document somewhere that you can also use php in shell-scripts?
  - print_r will NOT continue forever anymore on recursive arr's.
  - var_dump also not, but vardump simply quits at a too-high
    nesting level.

  (from php4/TODO):
  - improve documentation for the sablotron extension
  - update curl documentation
  - write documentation for the bzip2 extension
  - write documentation for the zziplib extension

  (from bugs):
  - see bugs.php.net for now
