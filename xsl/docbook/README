README for the DocBook Stylesheets
$Id$

These are XSL stylesheets for transforming DocBook XML document
instances into various output formats. (They would also work for
transforming DocBook SGML document instances, modulo certain
namecase problems and the fact that there aren't (yet) any XSL
implementations that work with SGML source documents.)

For more information, see http://docbook.sourceforge.net/
