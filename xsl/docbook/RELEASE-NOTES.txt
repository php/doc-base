These are the release notes for the DocBook XSL Stylesheets. This file
documents (mostly) changes to the public APIs. What, exactly, counts as a
public API is still somewhat in question, but it includes at least the global
parameters.

You may also be interested in the more detailed WhatsNew file.

Release 1.67.2

This release fixes a table bug introduced in the 1.67.1 release.

Release 1.67.1

This release includes a number of bug fixes; for details, see the WhatsNew
file.

The following lists provide details about API and feature changes.

FO

  * Tables: Inherited cell properties are now passed to the
    table.cell.properties template so they can be overridden by a
    customization.

  * Tables: Added support for bgcolor PI on table row element.

  * TOCs: Added new parameter simplesect.in.toc; default value of 0 causes
    simplesect to be omitted from TOCs; to cause simplesect to be included in
    TOCs, you must set the value of simplesect.in.toc to 1.Comment from Norm:

        Simplesect elements aren't supposed to appear in the ToC at all... The
        use case for simplesect is when, for example, every chapter in a book
        ends with "Exercises" or "For More Information" sections and you don't
        want those to appear in the ToC.

  * Sections: Reverted change that caused a variable reference to be used in a
    template match and rewrote code to preserve intended semantics.

  * Lists: Added workaround to prevent "* 0.60 + 1em" garbage in list output
    from PassiveTeX

  * Moved the literal attributes from component.title to the
    component.title.properties attribute-set so they can be customized.

  * Lists: Added glossdef's first para to special handling in
    fo:list-item-body.

HTML

  * TOCs: Added new parameter simplesect.in.toc; for details, see the list of
    FO changes for this release.

  * Indexing: Added new parameter index.prefer.titleabbrev; when set to 1,
    index references will use titleabbrev instead of title when available.

HTML Help

  * Added support for generating windows-1252-encoded output using Saxon; for
    more details, see the list of XSL Java extensions changes for this release.

man pages

  * Replaced named/numeric character-entity references for non-breaking space
    with groff equivalent (backslash-tilde).

XSL Java extensions

  * Saxon extensions: Added the Windows1252 class. It extends Saxon 6.5.x with
    the windows-1252 character set, which is particularly useful when
    generating HTML Help for Western European Languages (code from Pontus
    Haglund and contributed to the DocBook community by Sectra AB, Sweden).

    To use:

     1. Make sure that the Saxon 6.5.x jar file and the jar file for the
        DocBook XSL Java extensions are in your CLASSPATH

     2. Create a DocBook XSL customization layer -- a file named
        mystylesheet.xsl or whatever -- that, at a minimum, contains the
        following:

          <xsl:stylesheet
            xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
            version='1.0'>
            <xsl:import href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl"/>
            <xsl:output method="html" encoding="WINDOWS-1252" indent="no"/>
            <xsl:param name="htmlhelp.encoding" select="WINDOWS-1252"></xsl:param>
            <xsl:param name="chunker.output.encoding" select="WINDOWS-1252"></xsl:param>
            <xsl:param name="saxon.character.representation" select="native"></xsl:param>
          </xsl:stylesheet>

        Invoke Saxon with the encoding.windows-1252 Java system property set to
        com.nwalsh.saxon.Windows1252; for example

          java \
            -Dencoding.windows-1252=com.nwalsh.saxon.Windows1252 \
          com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet \
          mydoc.xml mystylesheet.xsl

        Or, for a more complete "real world" case showing other options you'll
        typically want to use:

          java \
            -Dencoding.windows-1252=com.nwalsh.saxon.Windows1252 \
            -Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl \
            -Djavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl \
            -Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory=com.icl.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl \
          com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet \
            -x org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader \
            -y org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader \
            -r org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver \
          mydoc.xml mystylesheet.xsl

        In both cases, the "mystylesheet.xsl" file should be a DocBook
        customization layer containing the parameters show in step 2.

  * Saxon extensions: Removed Saxon 8 extensions from release package

Release 1.67.0

  * A number of important bug fixes, documented in WhatsNew.

  * Added Saxon8 extensions

  * Enabled dbfo table-width on entrytbl in FO output

  * Added support for role=strong on emphasis in FO output

  * Added new FO parameter hyphenate.verbatim that can be used to turn on
    "intelligent" wrapping of verbatim environments.

  * Replaced all <tt></tt> output with <code></code>

  * Changed admon.graphic.width template to a mode so that different
    admonitions can have different graphical widths.

  * Deprecated the HTML shade.verbatim parameter (use CSS instead)

  * Wrapped ToC refentrytitle/refname and refpurpose in span with class values.
    This makes it possible to style them using a CSS stylesheet.

  * Use strong/em instead of b/i in HTML output

  * Added support for converting Emphasis to groff italic and Emphasis role=
    'bold' to bold. Controlled by emphasis.propagates.style param, but not
    documented yet using litprog system. Will do that next (planning to add
    some other parameter-controllable options for hyphenation and handling of
    line spacing).

  * callout.graphics.number.limit.xml param: Changed the default from 10 to 15.

  * verbatim.properties: Added hyphenate=false

  * Saxon and Xalan Text.java extensions: Added support for URIResolver() on
    insertfile href's

  * Added generated RELEASE-NOTES.txt file.

  * Added INSTALL file (executable file for generating catalog.xml)

  * Removed obsolete tools directory from package

Release 1.66.1

  * A number of important bug fixes, documented in WhatsNew.

  * Now xml:base attributes that are generated by an XInclude processor are
    resolved for image files.

  * Rewrote olink templates to support several new features.

      o Extended full olink support to FO output.

      o Add support for xrefstyle attribute in olinks.

      o New parameters to support new olink features: insert.olink.page.number,
        insert.olink.pdf.frag, olink.debug, olink.lang.fallback.sequence,
        olink.properties, prefer.internal.olink. See the reference page for
        each parameter for more information.

  * Added index.on.type parameter for new type attribute introduced in DocBook
    4.3 for indexterms and index. This allows you to create multiple indices
    containing different categories of entries. For users of 4.2 and earlier,
    you can use the new parameter index.on.role instead.

  * Added new section.autolabel.max.depth parameter to turn off section
    numbering below a certain depth. This permits you to number major section
    levels and leave minor section levels unnumbered.

  * Added footnote.sep.leader.properties attribute set to format the line
    separating footnotes in printed output.

  * Added parameter img.src.path as a prefix to HTML img src attributes. The
    prefix is added to whatever path is already generated by the stylesheet for
    each image file.

  * Added new attribute-sets informalequation.properties,
    informalexample.properties, informalfigure.properties, and
    informaltable.properties, so each such element type can be formatted
    individually if needed.

  * Add component.label.includes.part.label parameter to add any part number to
    chapter, appendix and other component labels when the label.from.part
    parameter is nonzero. This permits you to distinguish multiple chapters
    with the same chapter number in cross references and the TOC.

  * Added chunk.separate.lots parameter for HTML output. This parameter lets
    you generate separate chunk files for each LOT (list of tables, list of
    figures, etc.).

  * Added several table features:

      o Added table.table.properties attribute set to add properties to the
        fo:table element.

      o Added placeholder templates named table.cell.properties and
        table.cell.block.properties to enable adding properties to any
        fo:table-cell or the cell's fo:block, respectively. These templates are
        a start for implementing table styles.

  * Added new attribute set component.title.properties for easy modifications
    of component's title formatting in FO output.

  * Added Saxon support for an encoding attribute on the textdata element.
    Added new parameter textdata.default.encoding which specifies encoding when
    encoding attribute on textdata is missing.

  * Template label.this.section now controls whole section label, not only
    sub-label which corresponds to particular label. Former behaviour was IMHO
    bug as it was not usable.

  * Formatting in titleabbrev for TOC and headers is preserved when there are
    no hotlink elements in the title. Formerly the title showed only the text
    of the title, no font changes or other markup.

  * Added intial.page.number template to set the initial-page-number property
    for page sequences in print output. Customizing this template lets you
    change when page numbering restarts. This is similar to the
    format.page.number template that lets you change how the page number
    formatting changes in the output.

  * Added force.page.count template to set the force-page-count property for
    page sequences in print output. This is similar to the format.page.number
    template.

  * Sort language for localized index sorting in autoidx-ng.xsl is now taken
    from document lang, not from system environment.

  * Numbering and formatting of normal and ulink footnotes (if turned on) has
    been unified. Now ulink footnotes are mixed in with any other footnotes.

  * Added support for renderas attribute in section and sect1 et al. This
    permits you to render a given section title as if it were a different
    level.

  * Added support for label attribute in footnote to manually supply the
    footnote mark.

  * Added support for DocBook 4.3 corpcredit element.

  * Added support for a dbfo keep-together PI for formal objects (table,
    figure, example, equation, programlisting). That permits a formal object to
    be kept together if it is not already, or to be broken if it is very long
    and the default keep-together is not appropriate.

  * For graphics files, made file extension matching case insensitive, and
    updated the list of graphics extensions.

  * Allow calloutlist to have block content before the first callout

  * Added dbfo-need processing instruction to provide soft page breaks.

  * Added implementation of existing but unused default.image.width parameter
    for graphics.

  * Support DocBook NG tag inline element.

  * It appears that XEP now supports Unicode characters in bookmarks. There is
    no further need to strip accents from characters.

  * Make segmentedlist HTML markup more semantic and available to CSS styles.

  * Added user.preroot placeholder template to permit xsl-stylesheet and other
    PIs and comments to be output before the HTML root element.

  * Non-chunked legalnotice now gets an <a name="id"> element in HTML output so
    it can be referenced with xref or link.

  * In chunked HTML output, changed link rel="home" to rel="start", and link
    rel="previous" to rel="prev", per W3C HTML 4.01 spec.

  * Added several patches to htmlhelp from W. Borgert

  * Added Bosnian locale file as common/bs.xml.

Release 1.65.0

  * A number of important bug fixes, documented in WhatsNew.

  * Added a workaround to allow these stylesheets to process DocBook NG
    documents. (It?s a hack that pre-processes the document to strip off the
    namespace and then uses exsl:node-set to process the result.)

  * Added alternative indexing mechanism which has better internationalization
    support. New indexing method allows grouping of accented letters like e, ?,
    ? into the same group under letter "e". It can also treat special letters
    (e.g. "ch") as one character and place them in the correct position (e.g.
    between "h" and "i" in Czech language).

    In order to use this mechanism you must create customization layer which
    imports some base stylesheet (like fo/docbook.xsl, html/chunk.xsl) and then
    includes appropriate stylesheet with new indexing code (fo/autoidx-ng.xsl
    or html/autoidx-ng.xsl). For example:

    <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                    version="1.0">

    <xsl:import href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/fo/docbook.xsl"/>
    <xsl:include href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/fo/autoidx-ng.xsl"/>

    </xsl:stylesheet>

    New method is known to work with Saxon and it should also work with
    xsltproc 1.1.1 and later. Currently supported languages are English, Czech,
    German, French, Spanish and Danish.

Release 1.64.1

General bug fixes and improvements. Sorry about the failure to produce an
updated release notes file for 1.62.0?1.63.2

  * In the course of fixing bug #849787, wrapping Unicode callouts with an
    appropriate font change in the Xalan extensions, I discovered that the
    Xalan APIs have changed a bit. So xalan2.jar will work with older Xalan 2
    implementations, xalan25.jar works with Xalan 2.5.

Release 1.61.0

Lots of bug fixes and improvements.

  * Initial support for timestamp PI. From now you can use <?dbtimestamp format
    ="Y-m-d H:M:S"?> to get current datetime in your document. Added
    localization support for datetime PI

  * Added level 6 to test for section depth in section.level template so that
    section.title.level6.properties will be used for sections that are 6 deep
    or deeper. This should also cause a h6 to be created in html output.

  * Don't use SVG graphics if use.svg=0

  * Now uses number-and-title-template for sections only if section.autolabel
    is not zero.

  * Added missing 'english-language-name' attribute to the l10n element, and
    the missing 'style' attribute to the template element so the current
    gentext documents will validate.

  * Corrected several references to parameter qanda.defaultlabel that were
    missing the "$".

  * Now accepts admon.textlabel parameter to turn off Note, Warning, etc.
    label.

  * FeatReq #684561: support more XEP metadata

  * Added hyphenation support. Added support for coref. Added beginpage
    support. (does nothing; see TDG).

  * Added support for hyphenation-character, hyphenation-push-character-count,
    and hyphenation-remain-character-count

  * Added root.properties, ebnf.assignment, and ebnf.statement.terminator

  * Support bgcolor PI in table cells; make sure rowsep and colsep don't have
    any effect on the last row or column

  * Handle othercredit on titlepage a little better

  * Applied fix from Jeff Beal that fixed the bug that put secondary page
    numbers on primary entries. Same with tertiary page numbers on secondary
    entries.

  * Added definition of missing variable collection.

  * Make footnote formatting 'normal' even when it occurs in a context that has
    special formatting

  * Added warning when glossary.collection is not blank, but it cannot open the
    specified file.

  * Pick up the frame attribute on table and informaltable.

  * indexdiv/title in non-autogenerated indexes are now picked up.

  * Removed (unused) component.title.properties

  * Move IDs from page-sequences down to titlepage blocks

  * Use proportional-column-width(1) on more tables.

    Use proportional-column-width() for header/footer tables; suppress
    relative-align when when using FOP

  * Check for glossterm.auto.link when linking firstterms; don't output gl.
    prefix on glossterm links

  * Generate Part ToCs

  * Support glossary, bibliography, and index in component ToCs.

  * Refactored chunking code so that customization of chunk algorithm and chunk
    elements is more practical

  * Support textobject/phrase on inlinemediaobject.

  * Support 'start' PI on ordered lists

  * Fixed test of $toc PI to turn on qandaset TOC.

  * Added process.chunk.footnotes to sect2 through 5 to fix bug of missing
    footnotes when chunk level greater than 1.

  * Added paramater toc.max.depth which controls maximal depth of ToC as
    requested by PHP-DOC group.

  * Exempted titleabbrev from preamble processing in lists, and fixed
    variablelist preamble code to use the same syntax as the other lists.

  * Added support for elements between variablelist and first varlistentry
    since DocBook 4.2 supports that now.

Release 1.60.1

Lots of bug fixes.

  * The format of the titlepage.templates.xml files and the stylesheet that
    transforms them have been significantly changed. All of the attributes used
    to control the templates are now namespace qualified. So what used to be:

    <t:titlepage element="article" wrapper="fo:block">

    is now:

    <t:titlepage t:element="article" t:wrapper="fo:block">

    Attributes from other namespaces (including those that are unqualified) are
    now copied directly through. In practice, this means that the names that
    used to be ?fo:? qualified:

    <title named-template="component.title"
           param:node="ancestor-or-self::article[1]"
           fo:text-align="center"
           fo:keep-with-next="always"
           fo:font-size="&hsize5;"
           fo:font-weight="bold"
           fo:font-family="{$title.font.family}"/>

    are now unqualified:

    <title t:named-template="component.title"
           param:node="ancestor-or-self::article[1]"
           text-align="center"
           keep-with-next="always"
           font-size="&hsize5;"
           font-weight="bold"
           font-family="{$title.font.family}"/>

    The t:titlepage and t:titlepage-content elements both generate wrappers
    now. And unqualified attributes on those elements are passed through. This
    means that you can now make the title font apply to ane entire titlepage
    and make the entire ?recto? titlepage centered by specifying the font and
    alignment on the those elements:

    <t:titlepage t:element="article" t:wrapper="fo:block"
                 font-family="{$title.font.family}">

      <t:titlepage-content t:side="recto"
                 text-align="center">

  * Support use of titleabbrev in running headers and footers.

  * Added (experimental) xref.with.number.and.title parameter to enable number/
    title cross references even when the default would be just the number.

  * Generate part ToCs if they're requested.

  * Use proportional-column-width() in header/footer tables.

  * Handle alignment correctly when screenshot wraps a graphic in a figure.

  * Format chapter and appendix cross references consistently.

  * Attempt to support tables with multiple tgroups in FO.

  * Output fo:table-columns in simplelist tables.

  * Use titlepage.templates.xml for indexdiv and glossdiv formatting.

  * Improve support for new bibliography elements.

  * Added footnote.number.format, table.footnote.number.format,
    footnote.number.symbols, and table.footnote.number.symbols for better
    control of footnote markers.

  * Added glossentry.show.acronyms.

  * Suppress the draft-mode page masters when draft-mode is ?no?.

  * Make blank pages verso not recto. D'Oh!

  * Improved formatting of ulink footnotes.

  * Fixed bugs in graphic width/height calculations.

  * Added class attributes to inline elements.

  * Don't add ?.html? to the filenames identified with the ?dbhtml? PI.

  * Don't force a ToC when sections contain refentrys.

  * Make section title sizes a function of the body.master.size.

Release 1.59.2

The 1.59.2 fixes an FO bug in the page masters that causes FOP to fail.

  * Removed the region-name from the region-body of blank pages. There's no
    reason to give the body of blank pages a unique name and doing so causes a
    mismatch that FOP detects.

  * Output IDs for the first paragraphs in listitems.

  * Fixed some small bugs in the handling of page numbers in double-sided mode.

  * Attempt to prevent duplicated IDs from being produced when endterm on xref
    points to something with nested structure.

  * Fix aligment problems in equations.

  * Output the type attribute on unordered lists (UL) in HTML only if the
    css.decoration parameter is true.

  * Calculate the font size in formal.title.properties so that it's 1.2 times
    the base font size, not a fixed "12pt".

Release 1.59.1

The 1.59.1 fixes a few bugs.

  * Added Bulgarian localization.

  * Indexing improvements; localize book indexes to books but allow setindex to
    index an entire set.

  * The default value for rowsep and colsep is now "1" as per CALS.

  * Added support for titleabbrev (use them for cross references).

  * Improvements to mediaobject for selecting print vs. online images.

  * Added seperate property sets for figures, examples, equations, tabless, and
    procedures.

  * Make lineannotations italic.

  * Support xrefstyle attribute.

  * Make endterm on xref higher priority than xreflabel target.

  * Glossary formatting improvements.

Release 1.58.0

The 1.58.0 adds some initial support for extensions in xsltproc, adds a few
features, and fixes bugs.

  * This release contains the first attempt at extension support for xsltproc.
    The only extension available to date is the one that adjusts table column
    widths. Run extensions/xsltproc/python/xslt.py.

  * Fixed bugs in calculation of adjusted column widths to correct for rounding
    errors.

  * Support nested refsection elements correctly.

  * Reworked gentext.template to take context into consideration. The name of
    elements in localization files is now an xpath-like context list, not just
    a simple name.

  * Made some improvements to bibliography formatting.

  * Improved graphical formatting of admonitions.

  * Added support for entrytbl.

  * Support spanning index terms.

  * Support bibliosource.

Release 1.57.0

  * The 1.57.0 release wasn't documented here. Oops.

Release 1.56.0

The 1.56.0 release fixes bugs.

  * Reworked chunking. This will break all existing customizations layers that
    change the chunking algorithm. If you're customizing chunking, look at the
    new ?content? parameter that's passed to process-chunk-element and friends.

  * Support continued and inherited numeration in orderedlist formatting for
    FOs.

  * Added Thai localization.

  * Tweaked stylesheet documentation stylesheets to link to TDG and the
    parameter references.

  * Allow title on tables of contents ("Table of Contents") to be optional.
    Added new keyword to generate.toc. Support tables of contents on sections.

  * Made separate parameters for table borders and table cell borders:
    table.frame.border.color, table.frame.border.style,
    table.frame.border.thickness, table.cell.border.color,
    table.cell.border.style, and table.cell.border.thickness.

  * Suppress formatting of ?endofrange? indexterms. This is only half-right.
    They should generate a range, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.

  * Support revdescription. (Bug #582192)

  * Added default.float.class and fixed figure floats. (Bug #497603)

  * Fixed formatting of sbr in FOs.

  * Added context to the ?missing template? error message.

  * Process arg correctly in a group. (Bug #605150)

  * Removed 'keep-with-next' from formal.title.properties attribute set now
    that the stylesheets support the option of putting such titles below the
    object. Now the $placement value determines if 'keep-with-next' or
    'keep-with-previous' is used in the title block.

  * Wrap ?url()? around external-destinations when appropriate.

  * Fixed typo in compact list spacing. (Bug #615464)

  * Removed spurious hash in anchor name. (Bug #617717)

  * Address is now displayed verbatim on title pages. (Bug #618600)

  * The bridgehead.in.toc parameter is now properly supported.

  * Improved effectiveness of HTML cleanup by increasing the number of places
    where it is used. Improve use of HTML cleanup in XHTML stylesheets.

  * Support table of contents for appendix in article. (Bug #596599)

  * Don't duplicate footnotes in bibliographys and glossarys. (Bug #583282)

  * Added default.image.width. (Bug #516859)

  * Totally reworked funcsynopsis code; it now supports a 'tabular'
    presentation style for 'wide' prototypes; see
    funcsynopsis.tabular.threshold. (HTML only right now, I think, FO support,
    uh, real soon now.)

  * Reworked support for difference marking; toned down the colors a bit and
    added a ?system.head.content? template so that the diff CSS wasn't
    overriding ?user.head.content?. (Bug #610660)

  * Added call to the ?*.head.content? elements when writing out long
    description chunks.

  * Make sure legalnotice link is correct even when chunking to a different
    base.dir.

  * Use CSS to set viewport characteristics if css.decoration is non-zero, use
    div instead of p for making graphic a block element; make figure titles the
    default alt text for images in a figure.

  * Added space-after to list.block.spacing.

  * Reworked section.level template to give ?correct? answer instead of being
    off by one.

  * When processing tables, use the tabstyle attribute as the division class.

  * Fixed bug in html2xhtml.xsl that was causing the XHTML chunker to output
    HTML instead of XHTML.
