   <title>What is DocBook?</title>

   <para>
    First, don't be worried about learning another language or syntax
    because DocBook is fairly straight forward and most contributors
    simply cut-n-paste existing files, modify the content, then commit.
    It's just plain text.

    What is DocBook? The following is a quote from

   <para>
    <emphasis>
     DocBook is a very popular set of tags for describing books,
     articles, and other prose documents, particularly technical
     documentation. DocBook is defined using the native DTD
     syntax of SGML and XML. Like HTML, DocBook is an example
     of a markup language defined in SGML/XML.

   </para>

   <para>
    Simply this means that writing a DocBook file is no more than writing a text 
    file and using a few simple "tags" when needed. Like HTML, an opening tag is 
    a &lt; bracket followed by the tag's name, optionally some arguments, and then 
    the &gt; bracket (e.g. &lt;para&gt; for paragraphs). A closing tag is a &lt; 
    bracket followed by a / sign, the tag name, then the closing &gt; bracket 
    (e.g. &lt;/para&gt; for paragraphs). For example uses, have a look at an existing 
    file within the PHP manual sources, or use the <link linkend="chapter-skeletons">
    documentation skeletons</link>.
   </para>

   <para>
    As described above, DocBook uses a similar structure to HTML with the main
    difference being DocBook uses tags to define the <emphasis>meaning</emphasis>
    whereas HTML often times defines the look and layout. So the idea behind 
    DocBook is to define as much as possible about the information so that build
    and rendering software will intelligently output the text into many formats.
   </para>

   <para>
    We use DocBook because it makes it easy to generate several formats of our 
    documents (HTML, PDF, Microsoft HTML Help (CHM), RTF, etc.), and DocBook is 
    the standard way for storing structured technical information.     
   </para>
   
   <note>
    <title>DocBook version upgrade history</title>
    <para>
     On January 2, 2007 we upgraded from DocBook 4.1.2 to 4.5 and then
     to DocBook 5 at around June 20, 2007. These upgrades included changes 
     to most files in the phpdoc CVS repository.
