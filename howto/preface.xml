  <title>About This Document</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    <acronym>PHP</acronym> is well known for having excellent documentation,
    documentation that is created by volunteers who collectively make changes 
    every day. This HOWTO is designed for people who work on the official PHP 
    documentation. See also <link xlink:href="&url.php.docs;">&url.php.docs;</link> 
    for viewable and downloadable versions of the PHP manual.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    This HOWTO contains information about every aspect of the documentation
    process, which includes editing the DocBook <acronym>XML</acronym>
    sources, validating changes made to these sources, using the build system 
    to generate documentation into other formats, and general tips like how to 
    use <acronym>SVN</acronym>.
   </para>
  
   <para>
    Related to this HOWTO is the simple <filename>README</filename> file that 
    lives within the phpdoc SVN module. It's a quick guide for those already 
    familiar with the basics of XML and SVN.

    This document is based on many files, previously hosted
    in the phpdoc module at cvs.php.net, containing information
    about several distinct subjects, ranging from generating
    the HTML files from XML sources to starting a new translation.
    This is a central place for all these things. We tried to
    include the original authors in the authors list of this file.
