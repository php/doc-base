    This document is based on many files, previously hosted
    in the phpdoc module at cvs.php.net, containg information
    about several distinct subjects, ranging from generating
    the HTML files from XML sources to starting a new translation.
    This is a central place for all these things. We tried to
    include the original authors in the authors list of this file.
