READ THIS FIRST!!

This directory contains a working DRAFT of a new PHP Documenation
HOWTO.  It's being written in a very simliar format to the Linux
Documentation Project's HOWTO SGML document format.  Since both the
LDP docs and PHP docs are both written in SGML/XML, there aren't very
many differences between the two, so anyone should be able to jump
right in.  As a matter of fact, I'm using a modified copy of the main
PHP html.dsl stylesheet for this document's html formatting, so it
can't be that different.

You can find good examples of how to write LDP style documenation in
howto-template.sgml.  

Also, once you've loaded phpdoc-howto.xml into emacs, (you do use
emacs+psgml don't you?) be sure to parse the DTD and then save it as
phpdoc-howto.ced in the same directory as phpdoc-howto.xml.

Because I haven't finished joining this to the main configure script,
the Makefile is crude and the .dsl and .xml files use hardcoded paths.
It's possible that you may need to edit the location of the
docbook.dsl file at the top of hpdoc-howto.dsl in order for the
Makefile to work correctly for you.  As always your mileage may vary.

If you have any questions, suggestions or flames, please send them my
way.
