ABOUT THE PHPDOC HOWTO

This directory contains a working DRAFT of a PHP Documenation HOWTO.
It's being written in a very similar format to the PHP Documentation,
so anyone should be able to jump right in. As a matter of fact, we
use a modified copy of the main PHPDOC html.dsl stylesheet for this
document's HTML formatting (see phpdoc/howto.dsl), so it can't be
that different.

Also, if you use emacs+psgml be sure to parse the DTD and then
save it as howto.ced in the same directory as howto.xml.

To test the XML files for errors type:

  make test_howto

To generate HTML format from the xml file, go to the phpdoc
directory, and type:

  make howto

The HTML files will be generated in the html subdir of the
howto directory.

A copy is also available online at:

  http://www.php.net/dochowto

If you have any questions, suggestions or flames, please
send them to the phpdoc mailing list: phpdoc@lists.php.net.
