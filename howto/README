ABOUT THE PHPDOC HOWTO

This directory contains a working DRAFT of a PHP Documenation HOWTO.
It's being written in a very simliar format to the PHP Documentation,
so anyone should be able to jump right in. As a matter of fact, we
use a modified copy of the main PHPDOC html.dsl stylesheet for this
document's HTML formatting (see phpdoc/howto.dsl), so it can't be
that different.

Also, once you've loaded howto.xml into emacs, (you do use
emacs+psgml don't you?) be sure to parse the DTD and then save
it as howto.ced in the same directory as howto.xml.

To generate HTML format from the xml file, go to the phpdoc
directory, and type:

  make howto
  
The HTML files will be generated in the html subdir of the
howto directory.  Also, if you don't feel like generating it
yourself, this html version is also stored in the phpdoc
howto directory.  To uncompress, consider:

  tar xfvz howto.html.tar.gz
 
A copy is also available online at:

If you'd like to see the latest build.log for the online
PHP manual, it can be seen online.  Replace {LANG} with
your desired build log, such as en, fr or de:

  http://www.php.net/{LANG}/blog

If you have any questions, suggestions or flames, please
send them to the phpdoc mailing list: phpdoc@lists.php.net.
