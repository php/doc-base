ABOUT THE PHPDOC HOWTO

This directory contains a working DRAFT of a PHP Documenation HOWTO.
It's being written in a very simliar format to the Linux Documentation
Project's HOWTO SGML document format. Since both the LDP docs and PHP
docs are written in SGML/XML, there aren't very many differences
between the two, so anyone should be able to jump right in. As a
matter of fact, we use a modified copy of the main PHPDOC html.dsl
stylesheet for this document's html formatting (see phpdoc/howto.dsl),
so it can't be that different.

You can find good examples of how to write LDP style documenation
in howto-template.sgml.  

Also, once you've loaded howto.xml into emacs, (you do use
emacs+psgml don't you?) be sure to parse the DTD and then save
it as howto.ced in the same directory as howto.xml.

To generate HTML format from the xml file, go to the phpdoc
directory, and type:

  make howto
  
The HTML files will be generated in the html subdir of the
howto directory.

If you have any questions, suggestions or flames, please
send them to the phpdoc mailing list: phpdoc@lists.php.net.
