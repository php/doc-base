     you to fill in for making your own HOWTO; suggesting some names,
     conventions and contents for the chapters.

  <para>
   For various reasons this brand new release is codenamed the
   <emphasis>release</emphasis> release.
  </para>

  <para>
   New code names will appear as per industry standard
   guidelines to emphasize the state-of-the-art-ness of this
   document.
  </para>

  <para>
   This document was written when I read a feedback asking for a
   template to fill in to make new HOWTOs. This template was
   initially made by extracting the skeletal structure of the Multi
   Disk HOWTO which is a rather large HOWTO. It then went through
   extensive editing.
  </para>

  <para>
   Stating the background is a simple way to getting started
   writing the intro.
  </para>

  <para>
   First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development
   shows it is quite important.

  <title>Structure</title>

  <para>
   <emphasis>A quick overview on how all parts fit together in the overall
   structure. An example from the Multi Disk HOWTO is used.</emphasis>
 </para>

  <para>
   As this type of document is supposed to be as much for learning as
   a technical reference document I have rearranged the structure to
   this end. For the designer of a system it is more useful to have
   the information presented in terms of the goals of this exercise
   than from the point of view of the logical layer structure of the
   devices themselves. Nevertheless this document would not be
   complete without such a layer structure the computer field is so
   full of, so I will include it here as an introduction to how it
   works.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="logical-struct">
   <title>Logical structure</title>

    <indexterm>
     <primary>disk!structure, I/O subsystem</primary>
    </indexterm>

   <para>
    This is based on how each layer access each other, traditionally
    with the application on top and the physical layer on the bottom.
    It is quite useful to show the interrelationship between each of
    the layers used in controlling drives.

    Most users start out with a given set of hardware and some plans
    on what they wish to achieve and how big the system should be.
    This is the point of view I will adopt in this document in
    presenting the material, starting out with hardware, continuing
    with design constraints before detailing the design strategy that
    I have found to work well. I have used this both for my own
    personal computer at home, a multi purpose server at work and
    found it worked quite well. In addition my Japanese co-worker in
    this project have applied the same strategy on a server in an
    academic setting with similar success.
   </para>

   <para>
    Finally at the end I have detailed some configuration tables for
    use in your own design. If you have any comments regarding this
    or notes from your own design work I would like to hear from you
    so this document can be upgraded.

    Most newsgroups have their own FAQ that are designed to answer most
    of your questions, as the name Frequently Asked Questions indicate.
    Fresh versions should be posted regularly to the relevant newsgroups.

   <para>
    These are low-noise channels mainly for developers. Think twice
    before asking questions there as noise delays the development.
    Some relevant lists are <email>linux-raid</email>,
    <email>linux-scsi</email> and <email>linux-ext2fs</email>.  Many
    of the most useful mailing lists run on the <Literal
    remap="tt">vger.rutgers.edu</Literal> server but this is
    notoriously overloaded, so try to find a mirror. There are some
    lists mirrored at <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com">The Redhat
    Home Page</ulink>. Many lists are also accessible at <ulink
    url="http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists">linuxhq</ulink>, and the
    rest of the web site contains useful information as well.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you want to find out more about the lists available you can send
    a message with the line <command>lists</command> to the list server
    at <email>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</email>.
    If you need help on how to use the mail server just send the line
    <command>help</command> to the same address.  Due to the
    popularity of this server it is likely it takes a bit to time before
    you get a reply or even get messages after you send a
    <command>subscribe</command> command.
   </para>

   <para>
    There is also a number of other majordomo list servers that can
    be of interest such as the EATA driver list
    (<email>linux-eata@mail.uni-mainz.de</email>)
    and the Intelligent IO list <email>linux-i2o@dpt.com</email>.
   </para>

   <para>

   <title>Local Resources</title>

     <primary>disk!information resources!local</primary>
    </indexterm>

   <para>
    In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory
    installed, have a look in the <filename>/usr/doc</filename>
    directory. where most packages store their main documentation and
    README files etc.  Also you will here find the HOWTO archive 
    (<filename>/usr/doc/HOWTO</filename>) of ready formatted HOWTOs
    and also the mini-HOWTO archive 
    (<filename>/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini</filename>) of plain text
    documents.
   </para>

   <para>
    Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in
    the <filename>/etc</filename> directory. In particular you will
    want to work with the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file that
    sets up the mounting of partitions and possibly also
    <filename>/etc/raidtab</filename> file that is used for the
    <Literal remap="tt">md</Literal> system to set up RAID.
   </para>

   <para>
    The kernel source in <filename>/usr/src/linux</filename> is, of
    course, the ultimate documentation. In other words, <quote>use
    the source, Luke</quote>. It should also be pointed out that the
    kernel comes not only with source code which is even commented
    (well, partially at least) but also an informative
    <filename>/usr/src/linux/Documentation</filename>. If you are
    about to ask any questions about the kernel you should read this
    first, it will save you and many others a lot of time and
    possibly embarrassment.
   </para>

   <para>
    Also have a look in your system log file
    (<filename>/var/log/messages</filename>) to see what is going on
    and in particular how the booting went if too much scrolled off
    your screen. Using <command>tail -f /var/log/messages</command>
    in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update
    of what is going on in your system.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can also take advantage of the  <filename>/proc</filename>
    file system that is a window into the inner workings of your
    system. Use <command>cat</command> rather than
    <command>more</command> to view the files as they are reported as
    being zero length. Reports are that <command>less</command> works
    well here.

  <para>
   In the end you might find yourself unable to solve your problems
   and need help from someone else. The most efficient way is either
   to ask someone local or in your nearest Linux user group, search
   the web for the nearest one.
  </para>

  <para>
   Another possibility is to ask on Usenet News in one of the many,
   many newsgroups available. The problem is that these have such a
   high volume and noise (called low signal-to-noise ratio) that your
   question can easily fall through unanswered.
  </para>

  <para>
   No matter where you ask it is important to ask well or you will
   not be taken seriously. Saying just <emphasis remap="it">my disk
   does not work</emphasis> is not going to help you and instead the
   noise level is increased even further and if you are lucky someone
   will ask you to clarify.
  </para>

  <para>
   Instead describe your problems in some detail that will enable
   people to help you. The problem could lie somewhere you did not
   expect. Therefore you are advised to list the following information

   Remember that booting text is logged to

   the questions above. Obviously if the drives fail you might not be
   able to get  the log saved to disk but you can at least scroll
   back up the screen using the <keycap>SHIFT</keycap> and
   <keycap>PAGE UP</keycap> keys. It may also be useful to include
   part of this in your request for help but do not go overboard,
   keep it <emphasis>brief</emphasis> as a complete log file dumped
   to Usenet News is more than a little annoying.

      Q:How many physical disk drives (spindles) does a Linux system need?
     </para>

     <para>
      A: Linux can run just fine on one drive (spindle).  Having
      enough  RAM (around 32 MB, and up to 64 MB) to support swapping
      is a  better price/performance choice than getting a second
      disk. (E)IDE disk is usually cheaper (but a little slower) than
      SCSI.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Q: Are there any disadvantages in this scheme?
     </para>

     <para>
      A: There is only a minor snag: if even a single partition
      overflows the system might stop working properly. The severity
      depends of course on what partition is affected. Still this is
      not hard to monitor, the command <command>df</command> gives
      you a good overview of the situation. Also check the swap
      partition(s) using <command>free</command> to make sure you are
      not about to run out of virtual memory.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Q: OK, so should I split the system into as many partitions as 
      possible for a single drive?
     </para>

     <para>
      A: No, there are several disadvantages to that. First of all
      maintenance becomes needlessly complex and you gain very little
      in this. In fact if your partitions are too big you will seek
      across larger areas than needed. This is a balance and
      dependent on the number of physical drives you have.

    Greg Leblanc:  Depending on how big this FAQ gets, perhaps it
