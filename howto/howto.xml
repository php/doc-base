   The PHP documentation is written in XML using the <link
   linkend="docbook">DocBook DTD</link>. If you would like
   to contribute to the PHP documentation work, you need
   to at least now the very basics of XML and DocBook.
  </para>

  <para>
   The XML files are stored on a central server, and
   can be reached with a <link linkend="cvs">CVS</link>
   client. There are many CVS clients out there, although
   we recommend one command line tool.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   You will need more programs and tools to manipulate the
   XML files and test their content for errors. What tools
   you need depends on the operating system you use. Linux
   or some sort of Unix is recommended, although many things
   in phpdoc works on Windows. You will find more information
   about the tools you need in the
   <link linkend="tools-setup">tools</link> section.

 <sect1 id="tools-setup">
  <title>Tools used by the PHP Documentation Group</title>
   
  <para>
   What tools you need depends on the operating system you use.
   Linux or some sort of Unix is recommended, although many
   things in phpdoc works on Windows. The very basic things 
   you need to work:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>CVS account</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>CVS client</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>Text editor</simpara></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   The basic process is to check out (~download) the file
   using the CVS client, then edit it, and finally commit
   (~upload) it to the server. Of course you can find better
   tools to edit XML files than a simple text editor, it
   is just the absolute minimum. Some more useful tools:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>XML [capable] editor</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>Tools to test the edited file</simpara></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   In the folowing paragraphs, you can find information about
   how to obtain these tools and how to make them work for you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The last item in the above list (test the edited file) is
   the hardest to get working, as you need a copy of the English
   and your translations language files from the phpdoc tree. Also
   you need to set up the DocBook files, and several other tools.
   The viewable manual, and other formats such as PDF and RTF, are
   created using <ulink url="&url.jade;">Jade</ulink> and
   <ulink url="&url.nwalsh;">Norman Walsh's Modular DocBook
   Stylesheets</ulink>. There are other tools used to produce some
   other formats and files. It is recommended to set up the style
   sheets and Jade to be able to test your contributions. Otherwise
   you can easily cause headaches to other team members.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis>
    If you have information about other good XML editors and/or tools
    not mentioned here, please send it to the maintainer:
    <ulink url="&email.phpdoc;">&email.phpdoc;</ulink>.

  <sect2 id="tools-on-linux">
   <title>Tools on Linux</title>
  
   <para>
    Although many tools are preinstalled on the majority of
    the Linux systems, we collected some useful information
    about how they can be obtained and installed, if your
    system misses them.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    You will need your favorite text editor and a working
    <link linkend="cvs">CVS</link> installation. Although
    it is possible to use a simple text editor such as vi 
    to write the XML files, it is recommended to use an
    XML/SGML editor that helps you along and makes sure your
    document is proper XML conforming to the used document type
    definition (DTD). A very good (and free) XML/SGML editor
    is Emacs+PSGML. Both Emacs and CVS are already part of just
    about every Linux distribution available.
   </para>

   <para>
    You will also need <ulink url="&url.autoconf;">autoconf</ulink> to
    build the <emphasis>phpdoc</emphasis> GNU configure script. Many
    distributions come with autoconf already installed. The latest
    copy can be found at:

    <title>Obtaining the Tools</title>

    <para>
     To simplify the installation process of the tools necessary to
     write PHP documentation, we have chosen to detail how to download
     and install the source RPMs from a sourceware mirror. You will
     need a working copy of <ulink url="&url.rpm;">RPM</ulink> installed
     on the machine you wish to install these tools on.
    </para>

    <para>
     These tools are all seperate packages and can be downloaded and
     installed directly from the author's websites if you choose to do
     so. You do not have to use these source RPMs, but installing from
     the author's seperate packages is out of the scope of this HOWTO.
    </para>

    <para>
     The RPMs with the necessary software can be downloaded from one of
     the following URLs:

     You will need to download the following files:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>docbook-3.x-5.src.rpm</simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>jade-1.2.x-4.src.rpm</simpara></listitem>

   <sect3 id="tools-on-linux-installing">
    <title>Installing the Tools</title> 

    <para>
     Installing the tools is simple. If you downloaded all of the
     above files into a separate directory by themselves, simply issue
     the folowing command:
    </para>
   
    <para>
     <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
$ rpm -Uvh *.rpm
      </programlisting>
     </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
     Or, you can issue them one by one in the following order:
     <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
$ rpm -Uvh docbook-3.x-5.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh jade-1.2.x-4.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh jadetex-2.x-0.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh psgml-1.2.x-1.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh sgml-common-0.1-3.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh stylesheets-0.10-2.src.rpm
      </programlisting>
     </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
     That's it. You should now have necessary tools installed to edit
     and verify your PHP documentation contributions.

  <sect2 id="tools-on-windows">
   <title>Tools on Windows</title>
  
   <para>
    Although the phpdoc environment is based on many Linux
    tools and techniques, there are ways to accomplish the
    same tasks on Windows. It is not too hard to set up a
    Windows working environment with CVS and the DocBook
    tools, but put away your mouse as you will need the
    keyboard for the majority of the tasks! :)
   </para>
   
   <sect3 id="tools-on-windows-obtaining">
    <title>Obtaining the Tools</title>

    <para>
     You need the same tools as on Linux. The very basic
     thing is a CVS client. You can find one simple command
     line client here at the <ulink url="url.cvs-win">CVSHome.org</ulink>
     Win32 download pool. We do not recommend GUI tools such
     as WinCVS, because they can easily screw up the repository
     with files not intended to be there. The best is to use
     one command line client.
    </para>
   
    <para>
     If you want to produce something viewable, or just would
     like to test the modified file before committing (recommended!),
     you need some more tools. To get it running on Windows,
     you'll need these tools:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        <ulink url="&url.win.cygwin;">Cygwin (bash for windows; it's huge...)</ulink>
       </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        <ulink url="&url.jade;">Jade (the actual parser, take the windows binary dist)</ulink>

        <ulink url="&url.iso.entities;">Some ISO-entity declarations</ulink>
       </simpara>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     Note that if you use Cygwin, there is no need to download a
     CVS client, as Cygwin comes with a CVS client built in.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="tools-on-windows-installing">
    <title>Installing the Tools</title> 

    <para>
     You need to download and install the Cygwin tools. 
     Just select the "Install now!" link and run the supplied
     setup.exe. It will guide you through process of installation.
     These tools are port of standard unix tools like sed, awk,
     autoconf, make, perl, ... for Windows.
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Run "Cygwin Bash Shell" command from the Programs menu
     (it will be added here by the previous step). Now you get
     a command line which behaves same as bash on Unix boxes.
     If you never worked with bash or Unix before, note that
     there are slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\) in paths.
     If you want to access the <literal>foo</literal> directory
     on drive <literal>c:</literal> write it as
     <literal>c:/foo</literal> instead of <literal>c:\foo.</literal>
    </para>
    
    <warning>
     <simpara>
       Do NOT use symlinks with Cygwin, it's buggy. (Jade doesn't
       like them, and the shell doesn't handle them very well either)
     </simpara>
    </warning>
    
    <para>
     Change to the dir where your phpdoc snapshot is (or where you 
     want to have it). Use, just like windows, the <literal>cd</literal> command.
     In Cygwin, the <literal>dir</literal> command is also supported.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you don't have your snapshot yet, execute CVS (packaged with
     Cygwin). More information about CVS can be found in the
     <link linkend="CVS">CVS section</link> of this document.
    </para>
    
    <note>
     <simpara>
      If you decide to use another directory in one of the next
      steps, you'll probably need to modify
      <filename>phpdoc/configure.in</filename> manually.
      We do not give any support if you are self-opinionated :)
      Currently you can specify the DSSSL location manually
      by using the <literal>--with-dsssl=C:/path/to/dsssl</literal>
      option with configure.

    Now that you have write access to the CVS repository, let's setup
    a few variables in your <filename>.cvsrc</filename> file, add a
    <literal remap="tt">CVSROOT</literal> environment variable and
    login to the CVS repository.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you don't already have a <filename>.cvsrc</filename> file in
    your home directory, create one now and add the following lines to
    it:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
cvs -z3
update -d -P
checkout -P
diff -u
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    Each time you issue commands to the CVS repository, you have to
    specify the repository's cvsroot directory like this:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs -d :pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout <parameter>phpdoc</parameter>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    Instead of telling <command>cvs</command> where the repository is
    each time, you can set a default CVS repository in your <literal
    remap="tt">CVSROOT</literal> environment variable.
   </para>

   <para>
    For <literal remap="tt">sh</literal> and <literal
    remap="tt">bash</literal> users add the following to your
    <filename>.bashrc</filename> or <filename>.profile</filename>
    file.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
CVSROOT=:pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository
export CVSROOT
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    For <literal remap="tt">csh</literal> and <literal
    remap="tt">tcsh</literal> users add the following to your
    <filename>.cshrc</filename> or <filename>.tcshrc</filename> file.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
setenv CVSROOT :pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The <literal remap="tt">CVSROOT</literal> environment variable
     won't be set until the next time you log in.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    Now that you have the prep work out of they way, you will need to
    login to the CVS repository. Issue the following command:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs login
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    Or, if you don't have your <literal remap="tt">CVSROOT</literal>
    set, make sure you supply the correct <literal
    remap="tt">cvsroot</literal>:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs -d :pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository login
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    You will be asked to supply your password.  Once you successfully
    login to the CVS respository, your encrypted password is stored in
    the <filename>.cvspass</filename> file in your home directory.
    You won't need to log back into the same repository again unless
    you delete that file.

  <sect2 id="checkout">
   <title>Checking Out a Module</title> 

   <para>
    Now it's time to checkout the <parameter>phpdoc</parameter>
    module.  Incidently, a module is a collection of source
    directories and files.  Usually it's simply a directory tree in
    the CVS repository.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>cd</command> to a directory you wish to store the
    <parameter>phpdoc</parameter> tree under.  Wherever you decide to
    put it, a <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory will be created
    there.  Issue the following command:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs checkout <parameter>phpdoc</parameter>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>

  <sect2 id="update">
   <title>Updating the Tree</title> 

   <para>
    It's a good idea from time to time to update your copy of the
    <parameter>phpdoc</parameter> tree so that you always have the
    latest copy.  Currently, changes to the tree are made daily so you
    should always update your copy before making changes yourself.
   </para>

   <para>
    To update your copy, <command>cd</command> to the
    <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory and issue the following
    command:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs update
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you only wish to update a particular file or set of files you
    would like to modify, you can pass their filenames along with the
    update command:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs update <parameter>file1</parameter> <optional><parameter>file2</parameter></optional>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    If the files are located beneath the top level
    <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory, use the relative paths of
    the filenames:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs update <parameter>en/functions/file1</parameter> <optional><parameter>en/chapters/file2</parameter></optional>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="status">
   <title>Checking the Status of Files</title>

   <para>
    If you've made several changes to your local copy of
    <parameter>phpdoc</parameter> and would like to see what files
    have been modified, you can ask <command>cvs</command> what the
    current status of the file or files is.
   </para>

   <para>
    To see the status of all files in the current directory, issue the
    following command:

     <programlisting>
$ cvs status -l
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    This will usually generate a huge list, but you can narrow down
    the status information by supplying <command>cvs</command>
    specific filenames to check the status of:

    Once you have made changes to a file and validated your XML, you

   </para>

   <para>
    When commiting a file or files to the repository, it is polite to
    supply an brief message of what you have changed.  You do not need
    to document every single line you changed, that is part of CVS'
    job.  However, it is helpful to see a brief summary of what has
    changed from version to version without having to study the file
    itself.
   </para>

   <para>
    To commit a file, issue the following command:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs commit -m 'added new blah() function' <parameter>file1</parameter> <optional><parameter>file2</parameter></optional>

  <title>Validating Your Changes and Generating Documentation</title>

  <para>
   An important part of making contributions to the PHP documentation
   is being able to validate your changes and to be able to see what
   they will look like in their various forms, whether that is in
   HTML, Adobe PDF or RTF format.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="the-makefile">
   <title>The Makefile</title>

   <para>
    The <filename>Makefile</filename> controls serveral aspects of how
    documenation is validated and created.  To generate a
    <filename>Makefile</filename> from a fresh checkout,
    <command>cd</command> to the <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory
    and issue the following commands:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ autoconf

$ ./configure
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    This will generate a current <filename>Makefile</filename> for

   </para>

  </sect2>


  <sect2 id="validating-changes">
   <title>Validating Changes</title>

     <programlisting>
$ cd phpdoc
$ make test
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>

   ! These paras are from the howto.xml made by Stig (this
   ! is actually HTML). Can be useful to make the new XML
   ! file section.
 
  <a name="connecting.phpdoc"></a><h2>3.1. New SGML files</h2>

   The main file for the documentation is <tt>manual.sgml</tt>.  This
   file uses <i>entities</i> (can be compared to a combination of #define
   and #include in C) to include text from other files.  The entities
   that include the PHPDOC files are defined in the <i>preamble</i> of
  <tt>manual.sgml</tt>, which is the section between the "[" character
   on the first (DOCTYPE) line and "]&gt;".

  <p> Steps involved in connecting a new PHPDOC file:

  <ol>
  <li> Let us say you have written functions/ldap.phpdoc.  You should
   then add this to the preamble:
  <pre>
  <b>&lt;!entity ldapref system "functions/ldap.sgml"&gt;</b>
  </pre>

   This tells the SGML parser that when "ldapref" is referenced it
   should read the file <tt>functions/ldap.sgml</tt>.<p> <em>Note
   that the file name extension used here is not <tt>.phpdoc</tt>,
   but <tt>.sgml</tt>.  The Makefile handles the conversion.</em>
  <p>

  <li> Refer to the <i>ldapref</i> entity where you want to include it.
   Keep in mind that PHPDOC documents are converted into LINUXDOC
   sections.  Internal functions should be added to the "internal
   functions" chapter in <tt>chapters/functions.sgml</tt>.  Add
   something like this (the bold part is what to add):
  <pre>
   &lt;chapt&gt;Internal functions
   ...
  <b>&amp;ldapref;</b>
   ...
  </pre>

  <li> Then, to make sure the .phpdoc file is converted to .sgml,
   you have to tell make about it.  Add the <u>.sgml</u> file to
   the FUNCREF variable in <tt>Makefile.in</tt>.  Example (the bold
   text is the change):
  <pre>
   FUNCREF=functions/oracle.sgml \
  <b>functions/ldap.sgml \</b>
   functions/math.sgml \
   functions/mysql.sgml \
   functions/pgsql.sgml \
   functions/strings.sgml \
   functions/adabas.sgml
  </pre>

  <li> Finally, regenerate <tt>Makefile</tt>:
  <pre>
   (cd .. ; ./config.status)
  </pre>

  </ol>

  <a name="connecting.labels"></a><h2>3.2. Label name conventions</h2>

   When making or refering to labels in the LINUXDOC files, there are
   some conventions that should kept:

  <ul>
  <li> Internal functions have labels of the form
  <tt>func:<i>function_name</i></tt>.
  <li> Arguments to configure (when installing) have labels like the
   argument names.  For example, the -with-system-regex option has
   the label <tt>with_system_regex</tt>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <a name="convert"></a><h1>4. Converting from SGML</h1>

  <a name="convert.html"></a><h2>4.1. HTML</h2>

   You convert all the SGML files to HTML by running "<tt>make html</tt>".
   The current Makefile setup splits the chapters and appendices into
   separate files.  The main file is called <tt>manual.html</tt>, and the
   other files are <tt>manual-<i>n</i>.html</tt>.

  <p>If sgml2html shows some error messages like this:
  <pre>
   sgml2html -l -2 manual.sgml
   Making manual.html from manual.sgml.
   Problem with @@ref(id = security)!
   Problem with @@ref(id = func:include)!
   Problem with @@ref(id = func:pg_pconnect)!
   Problem with @@ref(id = func:stripslashes)!
  </pre>
   ..it is because of references that point to labels that do not exist.

  <a name="convert.text"></a><h2>4.2. Plain text</h2>

   You convert all the SGML files to plain text by running "<tt>make
   text</tt>".  The results can be seen in <tt>manual.txt</tt>.

  <p> <i>Note: there seems to be a bug in the 0.99.0 sgml2txt filter
   that messes up the section numbering in the table of contents.</i>

  <a name="convert.text"></a><h2>4.3 Other formats...</h2>

   SGML-Tools supports converting SGML to info, LaTeX, lyx and rtf as
   well.  PHP's documentation should be convertable to any of these
   formats in theory, but I have not tested it good enough to document it
   here yet.
