 <title>Tools and Setup Instructions</title>
  
 <para>
  The required tools depends on the Operating System. Linux is recommended,
  although several members of the documentation team uses Windows. All
  members require the following to commit:

     A <link linkend="cvs-account">CVS account</link>

     A CVS client, typically from the command-line.

 <para>
  The basic process is to <link linkend="cvs-checkout">check out</link>
  (~download) a file (or entire CVS module) using the CVS client,
  <link linkend="chapter-editors-all">edit</link> the file,
  <link linkend="chapter-configure">configure and validate</link> the file,
  review the diff/patch, and finally commit (~upload) the file to the server.
  Building and <link linkend="chapter-viewing">viewing</link> the file locally
  before commit is also an option.
 </para>

 <para>
  Note that the different translation projects use different encodings, so to
  work with these the text editor must support these encodings. Although the 
  English documentation often uses ISO-Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), it also uses
  UTF-8 so the text editor should understand UTF-8. Most do.
 </para>

 <para>
  Testing modifications takes a little time to get used to but after
  awhile it becomes natural. See the <link linkend="chapter-configure">
  configuration and validation</link> chapter for more information.
