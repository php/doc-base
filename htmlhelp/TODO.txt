! Please contact goba@php.net before modifying
! the code in the "htmlhelp" folder in CVS.

Important:

 - Add _function.html to the resulting CHM,
   which can redirect to a function page in
   the CHM. IDEs without direct PHP manual
   support can use this to integrate the CHM.

 - Make the build system support other languages
   then English. All the strings used need to be
   customizable. This also includes the porting
   of the charset conversion added lately to the
   "old chm" build system.

 - Make the build system run more automatically.
 
 - Make the build system run on Unix (except the
   hh compiler).

Additional:

 - Do not clean up the notesin and notesout
   directories if recently generated files
   are there (the "all" file is older then
   those files generated there).

 - Also do not clean up the "htmlout" directory
   if the files there are newer then the ones
   in the "html" directory.

 - Implement some detection for the $HTML_SRC
   and $HTML_TARGET directories, and don't do
   cleanups, and some copying, if they are the
   same.

 - Experiment with Brendan Ferguson's JS syntax
   highlighter and test it's usage in user note
   coloring. This would make the resulting CHMs
   much smaller, but needs JS magic (may be slow).

 - Document the skin framework, how it works, so
   others will be able to create their own skins.
