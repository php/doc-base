ini doc settings updater
========================

Note: PHP 5.0.2 and sqlite are required

To run this script, you just need to run: 'php run.php'
To get some help about the supported options run: 'php run.php --help'

The script will update the ini.xml files (if needed). After this, you should run
a 'cvs diff' and read it carefully and do not commit the changes if you feel
they are either wrong or the manually entered information is better.

Currently there is still some information that needs to be entered manually.
This information can be found in the 'cvs-versions' file and describes the active
CVS development branches.


Note: The sources of the PHP and PECL releases take about 1.5 GB of disk space as
of the end of 2007. However they can be shared with the functable script
(just do a symlink of the 'sources' folder).


Note: most scripts in this dir can be run alone for debugging purposes (they will
print their output arrays)
