# Some useful scripts for maintaining translation consistency of manual

Some of these scripts only test some file contents or XML structure
of translated files against their equivalents on `en/` directory.
Others will try modify the translations in place, changing the
translated files. Use with care.

Not all translations are identical, or use the same conventions.
So not all scripts will be of use for all translations. The
assumptions of each script are described in each file.

The `lib/` directory contains common code and functionality
across these scripts.

Before using the scripts, it need be configured:
```
php doc-base/scripts/translation/configure.php $LANG_DIR
```

## qarvt.php

`qarvt.a.php` checks if all translated files have revtags in the
expected format.

## qaxml.a.php

`qaxml.a.php` checks if all updated translated files have
the same tag-attribute-value triples. Tag's attributes are extensively
utilized in manual for linking and XIncluding. Translated files with
missing os mistyped attributes may cause build failing or missing
parts not copied by XIncludes.

## qaxml.e.php

`qaxml.e.php` checks if all updated translated files have
the same external entities as the original files. Unbalanced entities
may indicate mistyped or wrongly traduced parts.

## qaxml.p.php

`qaxml.p.php` checks if all updated translated files have
the same processing instructions as the original files. Unbalanced entities
may cause compilation errors, as they are utilized on manual in the build
process.

## qaxml.t.php

`qaxml.t.php` checks if all updated translated files have
the same tags as the original files. Different number of tags between
source texts and target translations may cause compilation errors.

Usage: `php qaxml.t.php [--detail] [tag[,tag]]`

`[tag[,tag]]` is a comma separated tag list to check their
contents, as some tag's contents are expected *not* be translated.

`--detail` will also print line defintions of each mismatched tag,
to facilitate bitsecting.

## Suggested execution

Structural checks:

```
php doc-base/scripts/translation/configure.php $LANG_DIR

php doc-base/scripts/translation/qarvt.php

php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.a.php
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.e.php
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.p.php
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php
```
Tags where is expected no translations:
```
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php acronym
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php classname
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php constant
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php envar
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php function
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php interfacename
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php parameter
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php type
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php classsynopsis

php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php funcsynopsis
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php methodsynopsis
```
Tags where is expected few translations:
```
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php code
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php computeroutput
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php filename
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php literal
php doc-base/scripts/translation/qaxml.t.php varname
```

# Migration

## Maintainers with spaces

The regex on `RevtagParser` was narrowed to not accept maintainer's names
with spaces. This need to be confirmed on all active translations, or
the regex modified to accept spaces again.

## en/chmonly

`en/chmonly` is ignored on revcheck, but it appears translatable. If it's a
`en/` only directory, this should be uncommented on RevcheckIgnore.
