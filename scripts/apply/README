Some useful scripts for maintaining consistency in phpdoc.

Use these scripts with scripts/process.php to consequently
modify/test things in XML source files. These are mostly
one-time scripts, but instead of writing each time a new
script, it's better to base it on an existing one.

Note, that these scripts cannot be used standalone.
