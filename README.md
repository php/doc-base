This repository contains the base source files and tools for converting
PHP's documentation, written in DocBook XML, into various presentation
formats like HTML and RTF.

Documentation for the tools used for building the PHP documentation and
how to contribute to the documentation and translations can be found in
[the `docs` directory](docs/README.md).

If you just want to read the documentation for PHP, look at:
